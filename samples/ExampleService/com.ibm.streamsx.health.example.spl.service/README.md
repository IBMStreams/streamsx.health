# Streams Healthcare SPL Example Service

This project demonstrates how one can create a SPL service to work with Streams Healthcare Analtyics paltform.  The SPl service is compiled and run by a Java wrapper.  The Java wrapper prvoides a consistent user experience to the end user.

## Directory Structure

Service has this directory structure:

```
com.ibm.streamsx.health.example.service
  |
  |---- info.xml - toolkit information of the service
  |---- build.gradle - build script for the Java service wrapper
  |---- service.properties - contain properties to be passed to the service
  |---- com.ibm.streamsx.health.example.spl.service - SPL code of the microservice
  |---- impl/java/src - contains Java code of the service wrapper
  |---- opt/lib - contains third-party libraries required by the wrapper or SPL service
```

## Service

A SPL service should adhere to the following guidelines:

* The SPL main composite should reside in a package with a *.service suffix. (e.g. com.ibm.streamsx.health.example.spl.service)
* The SPL main composite should be named with at `Service` suffix. (e.g. ExampleSPLService)

### Service Properties

Customization of a service should be defined in a service.properties file.  All services should support the following properties.  These properties are handled by AbstractService by default.

* debug
* streamscontext
* vmargs

A service may define a set of custom properties.  Custom properties should be scoped and prefixed with the service's fully qualified name.  (e.g.  com.ibm.streamsx.health.example.spl.service.property1).   The scoping allows us to combine properties from multiple services into a single property file, without running into name collision.    

### Publishing Data

Services employ a publish-subcribe model to receive or send data to another service.  When publishing data, topic definition should follow these guidelines:

* The topic be defined using the MQTT convention as noted by the Publish/Subscribe operator in the streamsx.topology toolkit. (e.g. /a/b/c/d)
* The topic should begin with the name of the service, delimited by "/"
* Next the topic should describe the data being published  
* The last segment of the topic should be a version number.  
* For example: /com/ibm/streamsx/health/example/spl/service/observations/v1
* All services publish data in JSON format, to maximize service interoperability with different languages.  
* If the data schema needs to change as the service evolves, follow these guidelines:
    1.  Adding a new attribute to the schema is not a breaking change.  Update the *minor* number of the topic version as follows to indicate a change in the schema:  e.g. a/b/c/observations/v1 -> **/a/b/c/observations/v1/1**
    1.  Renaming or removing of an attribute breaks compatibility.  If this has to be done, update the *major* nmber of the topic version as follows to indicate a breaking change:  e.g. **/a/b/c/observations/v2** 
    1.  Renaming or removing attributes is discouraged as it breaks application compatibility.  It is recommended that existing data stream is maintained.  New data stream can be added to a microservice to maintain compatibility.
 
### Subscribing Data

To subscribe data from an upstream application, a service should employ the following guidelines:

* If a service can only handle one version of the data being published, match the name of the topic exactly.  e.g. /com/ibm/streamsx/health/example/spl/service/observations/v1
* If a service can handle non-breaking changes in the data schema from an upstream application.  A service should subscribe to data using the **#** wildcard.  e.g. /com/ibm/streamsx/health/example/spl/service/observations/v1/# - In this case, as long as the upstream application does not bump the *major* version number, the service can continue to receive data.
    
## Service Wrapper   

* The Java service wrapper is responsible for the following:
    * Creation of a topology.  The topology invokes the SPL main composite.
    * Define additional properties a service may support.
    * Passing the properties found in service.properties to the SPL application
        
## Building a Service

A service is to be built using the build.gradle script.  The script is set up to build any Java code residing in the impl/java/src directory.
If a service require a third-party library, client is responsible to define these libraries in the build script.  The dependencies will be downloaded
by the build script and  stored in the opt/lib directory.  

## Executing a Service

* build.gradle is set up to execute the service, using the **execute** target.  
* Clients are expected to configure this target to identify the main class and jar file for running the service wrapper.
* Clients may also define additional execute targets if the project contains more than one service.
* Execution of the service will execute the Java service wrapper.  The wrapper in turn compiles the SPL service and submit the job to a streams context as described in service.properties.

## Evolving a Service

A service's API is defined by the following:

* Version Number in info.xml
* Name of the Service
* Properties in the service.properties file
* Parameters defined in the SPL application
* Data publication topic
* Data schema of the data being published

To maintain backwards compatibility and avoid breaking downstream applications, developers should follow these guidelines when evolving a service:

|API     |Guideline |
|--------|----------|
|Version in info.xml | Follow toolkit versioning guideline |
|Name of Service | Cannot be changed after it is defined |
|Properties in service.properties | New properties can be added without breaking compatibility.  Removing or renaming a property result in a breaking change. |
|Parameters defined in SPL application | New parameter can be added without breaking compatility.  Removing or renaming a parameter result in a breaking change.|
|Data publication topic | New topic can be added without breaking compatibility.  Adding new segments to existing topic can also be done without breaking compatibility.  Removing or renaming a segment of an existing topic is a breaking change.|
|Data Schema | New attributes can be added to the schema without breaking compatbility.  Removing or renaming an attribute is a breaking change.|
