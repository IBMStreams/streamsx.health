# Healthcare Data Simulator Service

This service simulates vital and waveform data for one or more patients. The types of data being generated includes: 

| Data | Sample Rate |
| :---: | :---: |
| Heart Rate | 10 samples/sec |
| BP Systolic | 10 samples/sec |
| BP Diastolic | 10 samples/sec |
| Temperature | 10 samples/sec |
| Sp02 | 10 samples/sec |
| Respiratory Rate | 1 sample/sec |
| ECG Lead I | 125 samples/sec |

The simulator produces data using the `Observation` type. The data is output using the **PublishConnector**, which outputs the `Observation` type in JSON. By default, the simulator generates data for a single patient, with a patient ID of "patient-1". The simulator can be configured to simulate more than 1 patient. Simulating data for multiple patients works as follows: 

  1. Generate values for vitals and waveforms for "patient-1"
  2. For each additional patient, duplicate the `Observation` record and replace the "patient-1" patient ID with another patient ID (i.e. patient-2).
  3. Publish the `Observation` tuples for all patients
  4. This process allows us to quickly generate data for 10s or 100s of patients while maintaining performance (since we don't need separate threads for each patient). 
    * The down-side to this approach is that since the `Observation` records are all copied, each patient will have the same set of vital and waveform values generated.

The service properties can be set in the `beacon.properties` file. The following properties are available: 

| Property | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | :---: |
| **numPatients** | Number of patients to simulate. | `1` |
| **patientIDPrefix** | The prefix to use when generating the patient ID. | `patient-` |

Run the following command to compile the SAB and launch the service: 

 `gradle execute`
